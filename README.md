# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver made with love2d and Lua

## Purpose
Made to learn the basics of the wave function collapse algorithm

## Scalability
As it is right now it won't work reliably if the tile with less entropy has more than one option, so it won't fit more complex sudokus, neither would it be useful for tilemap generation without more scaling.
